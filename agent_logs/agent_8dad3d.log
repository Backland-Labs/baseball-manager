Done. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

**Feature**: `repo_setup` (architecture category)

**What was verified/implemented**:
- The `repo_setup` feature was already fully implemented in the codebase but not marked as passing in `features.json`
- Wrote `tests/test_repo_setup.py` with 66 tests organized by each of the 6 feature steps:
  1. **PEP 723 metadata** (6 tests) -- `game.py` and `models.py` have inline metadata blocks declaring anthropic and pydantic dependencies
  2. **tools/ directory** (16 tests) -- All 12 tool files exist, `__init__.py` present, all tools registered in `ALL_TOOLS`
  3. **Pydantic models** (10 tests) -- `MatchupState`, `RosterState`, `OpponentRosterState` are properly defined with required fields and serialize to JSON
  4. **Decision output model** (7 tests) -- `ManagerDecision` model has decision, action_details, reasoning fields and serializes correctly
  5. **Entry point wiring** (10 tests) -- `game.py` imports Anthropic, registers tools with SDK, uses `tool_runner`, and uses `ManagerDecision` as output format
  6. **Runs with uv** (5 tests) -- `uv run game.py --dry-run` passes all validations, `--sim` mode works

**Test results**: 903 total tests pass (837 pre-existing + 66 new)

**Commit**: `c6c7a8a` pushed to `origin/main`
