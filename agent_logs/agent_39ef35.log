The `game_simulation_engine` feature has been fully implemented, tested, and pushed. Here's a summary of what was built:

**File: `simulation.py`** - The complete baseball simulation engine containing:

- **SimPlayer**: Runtime player representation built from roster JSON data
- **BatterGameStats / PitcherGameStats**: In-game stat tracking with proper PA/IP calculations
- **BaseRunner**: Base runner representation with player reference and base position
- **PlayEvent**: Play-by-play event records
- **TeamState / GameState**: Full mutable game state tracking lineups, bullpens, scores, runners, and substitution history
- **SimulationEngine**: The core engine with:
  - **Pitch-level resolution**: Each pitch is ball/strike/foul/in-play/HBP based on batter contact, pitcher stuff/control, and fatigue
  - **Ball-in-play resolution**: Batted ball type (GB/LD/FB/popup), direction (pull/center/oppo), and hit determination using player attributes
  - **Baserunner advancement**: Realistic runner movement based on hit type and speed (runners on 3rd score on singles, doubles clear bases, etc.)
  - **Walk/HBP resolution**: Proper force-advancement of runners (bases-loaded walks score runs)
  - **Double play mechanics**: DP probability based on runner and batter speed
  - **Error handling**: Errors based on fielder error rates
  - **Pitcher fatigue model**: Effectiveness degrades with pitch count relative to stamina
  - **Platoon advantage**: Same-hand matchups favor the pitcher, opposite favor the batter
  - **Defensive positioning effects**: Better fielding range reduces hit probability
  - **Auto pitcher management**: Pulls tired pitchers based on stamina-derived thresholds
  - **Stolen base resolution**: Success probability based on runner speed, catcher pop time, and target base
  - **9-inning games with extras**: Proper half-inning transitions, walk-off detection, and extra innings when tied
  - **Deterministic seeding**: Same seed produces identical games
  - **Box score generation**: Full formatted box score with line score, batting lines, and pitching lines
  - **Game state serialization**: JSON export for persistence

**File: `tests/test_simulation.py`** - 38 comprehensive tests covering all feature requirements, all passing.
