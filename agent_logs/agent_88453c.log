The `get_matchup_data` feature is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Feature implemented:** `get_matchup_data`

**Implementation (`tools/get_matchup_data.py`):**
- Loads player data from roster JSON (same pattern as `get_batter_stats`/`get_pitcher_stats`)
- Uses deterministic hashing of batter-pitcher ID pairs to simulate career plate appearances (0-45 PA), making results reproducible
- Derives matchup stats by blending batter attributes with pitcher attributes, accounting for platoon matchups (L/R handedness, switch hitters)
- Classifies sample size reliability: none (0 PA), small (<10), medium (10-29), large (30+)
- Computes similarity-model projected wOBA based on batter quality vs pitcher quality (always available, most useful with small/no samples)
- Builds pitch-type vulnerability breakdown (FF, SL, CH, and CU for high-stuff pitchers) with usage rates and wOBA_against
- Returns a meaningful "no history" response with null matchup_stats/outcome_distribution and a descriptive message when PA = 0
- Full validation: invalid player IDs, non-batters, non-pitchers all return structured error responses

**Tests (`tests/test_get_matchup_data.py`):** 25 tests covering all 9 feature steps plus edge cases -- all passing.

**Verification:** All existing tests (18 batter + 23 pitcher) still pass, dry-run validates successfully.
