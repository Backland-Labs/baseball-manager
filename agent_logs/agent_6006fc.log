The `repo_setup` feature is fully implemented, tested, marked as passing, committed, and pushed. Here's what was built:

**Files created:**
- `game.py` -- Main entry point with PEP 723 inline metadata, Claude Agent SDK `tool_runner` integration, 12 tools registered, `ManagerDecision` structured output, and a dry-run validation mode
- `models.py` -- All Pydantic data models: `MatchupState`, `RosterState`, `OpponentRosterState`, `ManagerDecision`, plus player attribute models (`Player`, `BatterAttributes`, `PitcherAttributes`, `FielderAttributes`, `CatcherAttributes`, `FullPlayer`)
- `tools/__init__.py` + 12 tool stub files -- Each tool is decorated with `@beta_tool` and returns placeholder JSON with proper structure
- `data/sample_rosters.json` -- Two complete 26-man rosters (Rivertown Otters and Lakewood Falcons) with all player attributes
- `.gitignore` -- Excludes `__pycache__/` and `.pytest_cache/`

**Validation:** `uv run game.py --dry-run` passes all 5 checks (models, tools, tool outputs, rosters, agent config). The full agent test works when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is provided.
