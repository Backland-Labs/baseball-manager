Done. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Feature: `decision_logging`

**What was implemented:**

1. **Modified `_call_agent`** (`game.py:245`) -- Now tracks tool calls (tool name + input parameters) and accumulates token usage (input/output tokens) across all agent turns in a single invocation. Returns a 3-tuple: `(decision_dict, final_message, call_metadata)`.

2. **Modified `run_agent_decision`** (`game.py:322`) -- Captures wall-clock latency via `time.time()`, aggregates tool call lists and token usage across retries, and returns a 3-tuple: `(decision_dict, messages, decision_metadata)`.

3. **Added `build_decision_log_entry`** (`game.py:421`) -- Constructs a comprehensive structured log entry containing:
   - Full game state at decision time (inning, half, outs, score, runners, batter, pitcher, situation display)
   - All tool calls the agent made with their parameters
   - The agent's full decision response (type, action details, confidence, reasoning, key factors, risks)
   - Active vs no-action classification
   - Token usage (input, output, total)
   - Latency in milliseconds
   - Agent turns and retry count
   - Timestamp for live game correlation

4. **Added `write_game_log`** (`game.py:476`) -- Writes structured JSON log files organized by game to `data/game_logs/`, with game info header (teams, seed, final score, winner) and aggregate summary statistics (total decisions, active count, token totals, latency totals).

5. **Updated `run_agent_game`** to use the new logging infrastructure.

6. **Added 81 tests** in `tests/test_decision_logging.py` covering all 7 feature requirements.

**All 837 tests pass** (756 existing + 81 new).
